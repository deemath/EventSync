üìò App Overview: EventSync
EventSync is a modular event management web application tailored primarily for organizing, managing, and analyzing events such as university workshops, seminars, and small-scale gatherings. It aims to streamline ticketing, attendee management, and post-event engagement through a clean and secure user interface.

üéØ Objectives
Simplify the process of creating and managing events

Provide seamless ticket sales and registration flows

Allow event organizers to track attendance and revenue

Enable feedback collection and post-event discussion

Ensure secure and role-based access to system functionalities

üë• Target Audience
University administrators or faculty members organizing academic events

Students hosting workshops or community events

Event attendees who need to register, purchase tickets, and give feedback

üîë Core Features & Functionality
Module	Description
Event Management	Create, update, delete events with date, time, location, and description
Ticket Sales	Define ticket types (free/paid), prices, and manage availability
Attendee Registration	User registration for events, linking users to specific events
Reporting	View sales reports, attendee counts, and basic analytics
Feedback & Discussion	Submit feedback, browse discussion boards related to specific events
Authentication	Secure login, role-based access (e.g., organizer, attendee)

üß± High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations
Layer	Recommended Tech
Backend	Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA
Authentication	Spring Security, BCrypt (password hashing), JWT (optional)
Database	MySQL or PostgreSQL
Frontend	Thymeleaf (for server-side rendering) OR React (for modern SPA experience)
Testing	JUnit, Mockito, Postman (for API testing)
API Style	RESTful API design for modular communication

üëâ My recommendation:
Use Thymeleaf if you're keeping things simple with Spring Boot. If you're open to a more dynamic experience (especially for discussions and feedback), React would offer more flexibility and modern UI/UX capabilities ‚Äî though it adds a bit more complexity.

üß© Conceptual Data Model (Simplified)
User: id, name, email, password, role

Event: id, title, date, time, location, description, organizer_id

Ticket: id, event_id, type (e.g., general, VIP), price, available_quantity

Attendee: id, user_id, event_id

Sale: id, ticket_id, attendee_id, purchase_date

Feedback: id, event_id, user_id, content, rating

DiscussionPost: id, event_id, user_id, content, timestamp

üé® UI/UX Design Principles
Clean, uncluttered layout with clear call-to-actions

Responsive design for access via desktop and mobile

Dashboard-style interface for organizers with charts (reports)

Simple ticket buying and registration flow for attendees

Comment-style discussion boards for each event

üîê Security Considerations
Password encryption using BCrypt

Role-based authorization: Only organizers can create/manage events

API access control using Spring Security filters

Optional: JWT-based stateless authentication if using React

Input validation and output sanitization to avoid injection attacks

üöß Development Phases / Milestones
Project Setup & Authentication

Spring Boot structure, login/registration, roles

Event Creation Module

CRUD for events, linked to organizer account

Ticket Sales Module

Define tickets, set limits, purchase flow

Attendee Registration Module

Register attendees, associate with events

Reporting Module

Sales and attendance reports with simple charts

Feedback & Discussion Module

Submit/view feedback, threaded discussions

Frontend Styling & UX Enhancements

Consistent theme, responsive layout

Testing & Debugging

Unit tests, integration tests, Postman checks

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Proposed Solution
Managing module independence	Use strict RESTful APIs and service-layer interfaces
Secure login and role handling	Apply Spring Security with granular role checks
Feedback & discussion complexity	Consider pagination, rate-limiting comments
Frontend-backend sync (if using React)	Use CORS setup in Spring, clearly defined API contracts
Data consistency in registration/ticketing	Use transactional services and data validation rules

üöÄ Future Expansion Possibilities
Add event calendar view with filters

Payment gateway integration for real ticket purchases

QR code check-in system for attendees

Notification system (email or in-app alerts)

Admin dashboard for superusers to monitor platform-wide metrics
